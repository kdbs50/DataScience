    "# Understanding Feature selection with Breast Cancer Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "Breast cancer (BC) is one of the most common cancers among women worldwide, representing the majority of new cancer cases and cancer-related deaths according to global statistics, making it a significant public health problem in today’s society.\n",
    "\n",
    "The early diagnosis of BC can improve the prognosis and chance of survival significantly, as it can promote timely clinical treatment to patients. Further accurate classification of benign tumors can prevent patients undergoing unnecessary treatments. Thus, the correct diagnosis of BC and classification of patients into malignant or benign groups is the subject of much research. Because of its unique advantages in critical features detection from complex BC datasets, machine learning (ML) is widely recognized as the methodology of choice in BC pattern classification and forecast modelling.\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis aims to observe which features are most helpful in predicting malignant or benign cancer and to see general trends that may aid us in model selection and hyper parameter selection. The goal is to classify whether the breast cancer is benign or malignant.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature selection with correlation, univariate feature selection, recursive feature elimination, recursive feature elimination with cross validation and tree based feature selection methods are used with random forest classification. \n",

    "   * texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)\n",
    "   * perimeter\n",
    "   * area\n",
    "   * smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)\n",
    "   * compactness (perimeter² / area — 1.0)\n",
    "   * concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)\n",
    "   * concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)\n",
    "   * symmetry\n",
    "   * fractal dimension (“coastline approximation” — 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "The mean, standard error and “worst” or largest (mean of the three largest values) of these features were computed for each image, resulting in 30 features. For instance, field 3 is Mean Radius, field 13 is Radius SE, field 23 is Worst Radius."
