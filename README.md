# Welcome to GreyAtom !

This is the GreyAtom repository for the **Data Science - Learn Program** . In here you'll find the Code Alongs that is going to be conducted by a mentor. 

The folders in this repository will cotain files required for the code alongs. The folder will contain:

- **Data** : This folder will contain the required data for the session.
- **Notebook** - This folder will contain two jupyter notebook, one without the solution and the second one with the solution.

**Code Alongs:**
